Buttons and Consistency: I made all the navigation buttons and input fields consistent with the red color scheme. The "X" button for removing fields was styled to be smaller and to have a small right margin.

Footer Removal: The code for the footer was completely removed from the CSS and HTML files.

Image Cropping: The images within the results list now have a uniform size and are cropped to fit their container, creating a more consistent and polished look.

Results Header: The top section of the results page was redesigned to be more organized and visually coherent. The sorting and navigation elements now have a cleaner, aligned look.
